# ByteVisualizer

A small program for viewing files visually. It reads any file as RGB input and displays it in a window. Currently very basic, but I plan to add the following features in the future:
- Change color modes
- Add GUI
- Add ability to export the image file
- Add statistical information about the file
- Anything else which may improve the program
